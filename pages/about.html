                        The Willimantic Orchestra is a non-profit 501(c)(3) community orchestra with a long and storied past that traces its beginnings back to the 1920s.  In its current form, the orchestra grew out of chamber music groups at Eastern Connecticut State University.

                        The orchestra still performs at ECSU as well as in other Willimantic and surrounding area sites.

                        Comprised of a mixture of seasoned musicians, college students and even younger talent, we come together to make music and fun for ourselves and the entire community.

                        Scott Chaurette, a classically trained string player and conductor, who is also experienced in the genres of jazz, rock, R&B and tango, is our conductor.  Performances feature traditional classical repertoire but also branch out into pops concerts and contemporary music.
